# Types of machine learning

The two main types of machine learning algorithms are

### 1\. Supervised Learning

### 2\. Unsupervised Learning

The other type of learning is the Reinforcement Learning algorithm which will be discussed later in this series.

1. Supervised Learning
    
    It is a type of machine learning algorithm in which the labelled data is used to train the algorithm for finding the patterns in the dataset with features and labels.
    
    The key characteristic of supervised learning is that it is can learn from the given example. In supervised learning, the input features of the given data are represented as x and the output label is represented by y. We are going to predict the right output from the given data.
    
    Example: Spam mail filtering is a good relevant example.
    
    There are two types of the supervised machine learning
    
    1. Classification
        
    2. Regression
        
2. Unsupervised Learning
    
    Unsupervised learning is also called descriptive analytics. It doesnâ€™t have labelled data to train these algorithms. Training using unlabelled data is called Unsupervised learning. From given data, it discovers patterns that help solve clustering or association problems.
    
    Example:News Section by google news, Computer Vision
    
    There are three types of unsupervised learning
    
    1. Clustering
        
    2. Dimensionality Reduction
        
    3. Anamoly Detection
        
    

The other types of machine learning algorithms which are quite popular in the modern world are **Recommendor Systems** and **Reinfoecement Learning**
